Follow `AGENTS.md` for repo guidelines.

Critical (Mindfly / consumer UX):
- Maintain high code quality (strict typing, no `any`, small composable changes).
- Proactively apply only low-risk refactors adjacent to your changes; avoid churn.
- Do not regress functionality; validate with lint/build/tests for non-trivial changes.
- UI/UX must match Claude.ai / Claude cowork-level polish but with distinct Mindfly branding.
- Theme accent color must come from the Mindfly butterfly icon (ask for canonical tokens if missing).
